# Cryptogram Project

Generate cryptograms from quotes and predict their difficulty using machine learning.  
This project extracts features from text structure, word patterns, and cryptographic statistics to estimate difficulty.  
Motivated by the shortage of high-quality cryptograms and inconsistent difficulty ratings in existing sources.
